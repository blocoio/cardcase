# Card Case

_Exchange your business card with people nearby_ ([Website](https://www.bloco.io/card-case))

Leave your paper business cards at home. With Card Case you can create your digital business card, and share it with people nearby in seconds.

Using Google’s Nearby technology, the Card Case app exchanges your business cards with people around you. You don’t need to create any account or send emails. And it works instantly.
